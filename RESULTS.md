# RESULTS

## Ver 1.0.0 29 March 2017

### Overview

Navigate to /results folder to see the results for different graphing data. There are two types of data:

1. Flat-Up Data
	+ Describes the state of the landscape where the recruitment is always constantly higher than that of mortality. 
	+ In other words, species of trees are always entering the plot.
2. Original Data
	+ Describes a higher relative recruitment rate in the beginning, before dropping below mortality rates. 
	+ In other words, representing dominant species that enter a plot in big numbers at the beginning before dying out.

### Specific Results + Analysis

2. Original Data
	+ Beta diversity: Drops heavily in the first 5 years due to high influx of a variety of species across plots. However it slowly increases to about the same level as the start after 30 years. This makes sense because as recruitment rates drop, the pool of species allowed to enter each plot decreases. This results in a greater possible diversity of species.
